# Joule Heating of a 1D Bar with Genetic Algorithm Optimization

This repository contains a physics-based simulation of transient Joule heating in a one-dimensional bar, together with a custom genetic algorithm (GA) used to optimize material and process parameters.

This project was completed as part of **ME 150 (Modeling & Simulation)** and follows formulations, assumptions, and numerical methodology presented in **Zodhi’s course reader**.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main components:

### 1. Transient Joule Heating Simulation

- Solves the one-dimensional heat equation with internal Joule heating using an explicit **Forward Euler** time-integration scheme.
- Includes four right-hand boundary condition cases (A–D):
  - Fixed temperature
  - Prescribed temperature
  - Zero heat flux (Neumann condition)
  - Constant cooling flux
- Analytical steady-state solutions are derived and plotted alongside transient numerical results for verification.
- Multiple spatial discretizations are explored to demonstrate convergence behavior.

### 2. Genetic Algorithm Optimization

- A genetic algorithm is implemented **from scratch** (no external GA libraries).
- The GA optimizes material and process parameters including:
  - Thermal conductivity
  - Electrical conductivity
  - Electric field strength
  - Density
  - Specific heat capacity
  - Boundary heat flux
- The cost function penalizes deviation from target temperatures at:
  - The maximum temperature in the domain
  - The temperature at the right boundary of the bar
- Convergence history (best, average, and parent costs) is recorded and plotted.

## Governing Equation

The transient temperature field in the bar is governed by the one-dimensional heat equation with internal Joule heating:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\rho%20C%20\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial%20t}
  =K\frac{\partial^2\theta}{\partial%20x^2}+a\sigma_cE^2" />
</p>

where:

- **θ(x, t)** — temperature field [K]  
- **ρ** — material density [kg/m³]  
- **C** — specific heat capacity [J/(kg·K)]  
- **K** — thermal conductivity [W/(m·K)]  
- **σ₍c₎** — electrical conductivity [S/m]  
- **E** — applied electric field [V/m]  
- **a** — Joule heating efficiency factor  

The source term **aσ₍c₎E²** represents volumetric resistive heating generated by the applied electric field.

## Numerical Method

The governing equation is solved using an explicit **Forward Euler** time integration scheme combined with
second-order **finite differences** in space.

- **Spatial discretization:** uniform grid  
- **Time integration:** explicit Forward Euler  
- **Boundary conditions:** fixed temperature and flux-based conditions  
- **Stability:** time step selected to satisfy diffusion stability constraints  

The numerical implementation supports both transient analysis and steady-state convergence studies. All discretization and solution procedures follow the methodology presented in **Zodhi’s course reader**.
